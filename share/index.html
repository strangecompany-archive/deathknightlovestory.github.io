<p>Death Knight Love Story is a labour of love, made on a completely non-profit basis, on a budget that's less than a tenth of even "low-budget" animated TV, let alone animated feature films.

<p>To make it as easy as possible for you to do that, here are a whole bunch of ready-prepared resources, including <b>embeddable video, images from the film, images from behind the scenes, Tweets, and interesting facts about the film</b>. 

<P>Feel free to share 'em, tweet 'em, blog 'em, pin 'em, or whatever else you want to do! 

<p>And please do <a href="../contact/index.html">let us know</a> if you join in spreading the word - we'd love to say "thanks"!

<h2>Fun Facts About Death Knight Love Story</h2>

<ol><li>The production of Death Knight Love Story took 5 years all told. During that time, Hugh and the rest of the team threw away near-complete drafts of the film three times over. </li>
<li>The motion capture didn't always use very appropriate props: for example, the cannon loading sequence was acted using a mop, a litter bin, and some waste plastic found in the warehouse we were using as a studio!</li>
<li>At one point Hugh became so fed up with existing motion capture technology that he developed his own motion capture system, which had an entire wearable computer attached to the waistband.</li>
<li>Three crew members have had children born during the course of Death Knight Love Story's production. </li>
<li>Death Knight Love Story's crew come from three continents and even more countries, including Scotland, Iceland, India, and the USA. </li>
<li>One of the less necessary delays to Death Knight Love Story's production happened when Hugh forgot to check that the 3D models for his lead characters could actually open their mouths!</li>
<li>Death Knight Love Story is actually technically a "Machinima" animated film: it was entirely created in the real-time 3D rendering software "Mach Studio Pro", using the same techniques used by computer games like Far Cry 3.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Fun Facts About The Cast And Crew of Death Knight Love Story</h2>

<ol><li>Hugh Hancock, the director, has been making films using computer games for over 15 years, and is the man responsible for the word "Machinima".</li>
<li>Anna Chancellor, who plays Miria, has played an extremely eclectic series of film and television roles, from "Duckface" in the '90s UK hit "Four Weddings And A Funeral" to "Questular Rontok" in the film adaption of "Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy". </li>
<li>Brian Blessed, who plays Arthas, is equally well-known as one of the UK's great Shakespearean actors and as a larger-than-life TV and film personality. The website TV Tropes has an informal rule that Brian shall always be referred to in capital letters.</li>
<li>Jack Davenport, who plays Zelieck, is best known for his role as Commander Norrington in "Pirates of the Carribean". He is currently in the news as the possible replacement for Daniel Craig in the role of James Bond!</li>
<li>Joanna Lumley, who plays Lady Blaumeaux, is best known as Patsy in TV series "Absolutely Fabulous", as well as for her voice-acting work on Tim Burton's "The Corpse Bride". She's currently in the headlines for her role in Martin Scorsese's "The Wolf Of Wall Street".</li>
<li>Ross Campbell, who composed the music for Death Knight Love Story, has moved over the years from house music with Scottish band Nightcrawlers to work with Scottish Opera to composing the music for dour detective series Taggart.</li>
<li>The animators who worked on Death Knight Love Story come from very different backgrounds: lead animator Justin Hall worked on Oscar-nominated arthouse animation "The Illusionist", whilst facial animator Tom Bryant has worked with UK pop band Gorillaz.</li>
<li>DKLS's motion capture artists learned their skills in many different ways: Ross Bambrey was a fire juggler and appeared in UK TV series Merlin, whilst Ian Mulliner learned his physical acting through Live-Action Roleplaying.</li></ol>
